# Reporting in Load Testing
---
### General Overview
Reporting in load testing (LT) is the process of systematizing and presenting test results. The main objective of reports is to provide stakeholders (developers, DevOps engineers, managers, and clients) with a comprehensive understanding of system performance and detected issues. A well-structured report helps make informed decisions regarding the need for system improvements, scaling, or infrastructure enhancements. Reports include key metrics, graphs, conclusions, and recommendations, ensuring transparency of results and their interpretation.

### Objectives
- **Systematize LT results:**
    - Summary of completed tests.
    - Key metrics reflecting system status.
- **Visualize results:**
    - Clear graphs and charts for performance analysis.
- **Provide improvement recommendations:**
    - Identify bottlenecks and weak points.
    - Suggestions for performance optimization.
- **Standardize reporting format:**
    - Approve templates to unify reports.

### Technology Stack
- **Grafana:**
    - Dashboard creation for data visualization.
    - Build charts for response time, throughput, and other metrics.
- **Confluence:**
    - Store reports and documentation.
    - Collaborate on reports within a single workspace.
- **Additional Tools:**
    - **JMeter:** basic reporting and data export.
    - **Prometheus:** metric collection for analysis.
    - **Python/Matplotlib:** custom data processing and chart generation.

### Theoretical Description
#### 1. LT Report Structure
A report should be structured and include the following sections:
- **Introduction:**
    - Brief description of the system under test.
    - Testing objectives (e.g., verifying maximum API performance).
    - Types of tests conducted (e.g., stress, steady load).
- **Summary:**
    - Total number of requests executed.
    - Peak load (e.g., 5000 RPS).
    - Total test duration.
- **Key Performance Metrics:**
    - **Latency (response time):**
        - Average, max, and percentile values (e.g., 90th, 95th).
    - **Throughput:**
        - Requests per second (RPS).
    - **Error Rate:**
        - Percentage of failed requests (e.g., 4xx and 5xx).
    - **Resource Utilization:**
        - CPU, memory, network, and disk usage.
- **Data Visualization:**
    - **Charts and Graphs:**
        - Response Time over time.
        - Resource usage (CPU, RAM) under increasing load.
        - Error Rate relative to load level.
- **Analysis and Conclusions:**
    - Detected issues (e.g., database bottlenecks, high CPU utilization).
    - Load threshold where system stability degrades.
    - SLA achievement or violation.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Optimization suggestions (e.g., connection pool tuning, infrastructure scaling).

#### 2. Data Visualization in Grafana
Grafana is used to create interactive dashboards to visualize results in real-time or post-test.
- **Data Source Connection:**
    - Configure Prometheus or InfluxDB as data sources for Grafana.
    - Import data such as response time, request rate, and CPU load.
- **Dashboard Creation:**
    - **Response Time Chart:**
        - Shows how Latency changes with increasing load.
    - **Throughput Chart:**
        - Displays RPS over time.
    - **Error Chart:**
        - Displays Error Rate over time or requests.
    - **Resource Utilization:**
        - CPU, memory, network, I/O.
- **Dashboard Templates:**
    - Pre-built templates from Grafana Dashboards can accelerate the process.

#### 3. Documentation and Report Storage in Confluence
- **Create Sections in Confluence:**
    - **Introduction:** system description and test objectives.
    - **Results:** key metrics with graphs and tables.
    - **Conclusions:** improvement recommendations.
- **Collaboration:**
    - Co-edit and discuss reports within the team.
    - Easy access to results for all stakeholders.

#### 4. Example LT Report
- **System Name:** Online Store
- **Test Objective:** Assess REST API performance under peak load
- **Metrics:**
    - Average response time: 250 ms.
    - 90th percentile response time: 400 ms.
    - Throughput: 1000 RPS.
    - Error rate: 2% (50 out of 2500 requests).
- **Conclusions:**
    - System meets SLA up to 800 RPS.
    - Bottleneck: overloaded database under increased load.

### Summary
Load testing reporting helps systematize data, identify bottlenecks, and provide actionable recommendations. Tools like Grafana for visualization and Confluence for storage make the reporting process efficient and transparent. Approved templates simplify report reuse and maintain a consistent format for presenting results.
