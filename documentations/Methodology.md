# Load Testing Methodology
---
## Overview
The load testing methodology is a strategic document describing the objectives, tasks, approaches, tools, and step-by-step procedures for performing load testing. It serves as a guide for the team, streamlining the planning, organization, and execution of tests while ensuring a common understanding of the entire process.

The methodology helps structure testing, minimize errors, and adapt the process to project goals and client expectations. It is the foundation for effective execution of all stages of load testing.

## Goals
### Define key tasks:
- Identify important metrics (e.g., Latency, Throughput, Error Rate).
- Determine load volume and types of tests to achieve objectives.

### Formulate testing steps:
- Create a step-by-step plan, including preparation, test execution, data collection, and analysis.

### Align methodology with the team:
- Ensure unified standards and approaches within the team.
- Consider infrastructure, resource, and timeline constraints.

### Support process transparency:
- Set clear expectations between team members and business stakeholders.

## Theoretical Description

### 1. Define Objectives:
At this stage, key load testing tasks are formulated:
- Validate non-functional requirements:
    - API response time no more than 200ms for 95% of requests.
    - System throughput â€” at least 5000 RPS.
- Identify maximum performance:
    - Determine peak request or user capacity.
- Detect system bottlenecks:
    - Components causing latency or failures under increased load.
- Perform stability testing:
    - Verify system operation under constant load over time.

### 2. Select Testing Approaches:
Choose the approaches to meet objectives:
- Load Models:
    - Closed model (fixed number of users).
    - Open model (fixed request rate).
- Types of load testing:
    - Maximum performance testing, stress testing, volume testing.
- Test Scenarios:
    - User scenarios (e.g., placing an order in an online store).
    - Functional scenarios (e.g., executing SQL queries).

### 3. Data Preparation:
Prepare all necessary elements:
- Test Data:
    - Users, profiles, sessions.
    - Database records (e.g., 1 million records for query testing).
- Test Environments:
    - Deploy an environment with production-like characteristics.
    - Configure monitoring tools to collect metrics.

### 4. Execute Tests:
Main steps for executing load tests:
- Configure test scenarios in tools (JMeter, K6).
- Run tests with gradual load increase.
- Monitor the system in real-time using Prometheus and Grafana.

### 5. Analyze Results:
Analyze collected data after tests:
- Key Metrics:
    - Average response time.
    - Throughput.
    - Error count.
- Identify bottlenecks:
    - For example, the database is a bottleneck due to high CPU utilization.
- Provide recommendations:
    - Code optimization, resource scaling, architecture changes.

## Summary
The load testing methodology is a strategic document that defines how testing will be conducted. It includes setting objectives, selecting approaches, preparing data, executing tests, and analyzing results. A well-developed methodology helps structure the process, reduce errors, and align testing with team and client expectations.

The methodology becomes the foundation for successful load testing and system quality improvement.
